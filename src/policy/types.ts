/**

 * construction, identical to `coordination(humansOverwrite())` applied to every
 * model — so a developer who wants different behaviour just declares the conflict
 * axis on that model (`humansReject()`, `humansNotify()`, `systemOverwrite()`, …)
 * and it wins. The default and the override speak the same vocabulary; the
 * default is the one you get for free.
 *
 *   • `user`   → `allow`  — a human is never blocked by a claim (a claim is a
 *                           coordination hint among agents, not a lock on people)
 *   • `agent`  → `reject` — an agent yields to a foreign claim (the no-bypass
 *                           invariant; the ONLY sanctioned agent override is the
 *                           privileged `claim.preempt` capability seam, see
 *                           {@link capabilityPreemptPolicy})
 *   • `system` → `reject` — automation / backend (`sk_`) writers SERIALIZE
 *                           through claims by default like agents do, so a server
 *                           job can't silently steamroll a held row. Opt a model
 *                           in with `systemOverwrite()` when that's wanted.
 *
 * Scope note: only `user` is allowed by default — that is the exact Law 7
 * decision ("a human is never blocked"). `system` is deliberately NOT a
 * free-bypass: `sk_` keys are full-access backend credentials, and a foundational
 * contract (claim serialization / the retry-storm guard) depends on them
 * respecting claims unless a model says otherwise.
 *
 * `stale_context` conflicts honor the committer's declared `onStale` intent:
 *
 *   • `'notify'` → notify + hold (op withheld; the actor resolves)
 *   • anything else (incl. `'reject'`, absent) → reject
 *
 * `'overwrite'` never reaches a policy on the stale path — it's a hard opt-out
 * resolved before detection.
